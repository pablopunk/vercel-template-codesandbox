# Vercel template for Codesandbox.io

> Run `vercel dev` on the cloud

Open a terminal in codesandbox and login to Vercel:

```sh
$ npm run login
```

Now run `yarn start` and setup your vercel project. You will only have to do this once. After that, the server will always automatically run it for you.

Once it's ready on `localhost:3000`, you'll be able to see it on codesandbox browser ðŸŽ‰
